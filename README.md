# Advent of Code 2020
These are my attempts to solve the tasks in Advent of Code 2020.
I have chosen to implement my solutions in python because it's a fun and quick language and because I want to deepen my knowledge. 

If a solution seems barely readable it's probably because I stayed up way too late to solve it.
